// What is Typescript? Why do we use it?

    // Typescript is a "superset" to JavaScript; extends JavaScript. TS adds more features to the JS syntax.
    // Adds STATIC TYPING to JavaScript; JS on its own is DYNAMICALLY typed.

// TypeScript DOES NOT run in the browser, we need to compile our TS into JS to run it in the browser.
